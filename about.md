My name is Patrick Boatner. I'm a software engineer, a servant of God, a husband, and a father. I have a passion for turning the world around me into a "well-oiled" machine; technology and software engineering is my favorite way to do that. I enjoy music (various instruments + singing), nature, board sports, and hobby electronics.

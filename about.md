My name is Patrick Boatner. I'm a software engineer. I'm passionate about solving problems for people and making things run like a smooth, well-oiled machine. Outside of work, I'm a husband, a father, and a servant of God. My faith pushes me to do professional work "heartily, as for the Lord", but also to keep a good work-life balance with a weekly Shabbat. I enjoy music (various instruments + singing), nature, board sports, and hobby electronics.

My name is Patrick Boatner. I'm a software engineer. Outside of work, I'm a husband, a father, and a servant of God. My faith pushes me to do professional work "heartily, as for the Lord", but also to keep a good work-life balance with a weekly Shabbat. I have a passion for turning the world around me into a "well-oiled" machine; technology and software engineering is my favorite way to do that. I enjoy music (various instruments + singing), nature, board sports, and hobby electronics.

Hey, I'm Patrick, a product-minded software engineer. I have a passion to solve problems for people and make things run smoothly. When I lead projects, I study the big picture so I can deliver whatever outcome the customer really needs. I care about engineering excellence, but I also know when to be pragmatic. I use my communication and mentoring skills to act as a multiplier on remote teams.

I'm primarily skilled in Ruby on Rails / React / Postgres / Sidekiq, but I adapt quickly to whatever tool helps us ship impactful features and fixes. I'm comfortable doing dev/architecture work with LLMs or without. I'm interested in small/medium sized companies that rely on ownership (not heavy process) to delight customers. If that resonates with you, I'd love to join your team.

Outside of work, I'm a dad and a servant of God. I do my engineering work "heartily, as for the Lord", but I also keep a good work-life balance with a weekly Shabbat. I like to tinker with hobby electronics and home improvement projects. I enjoy music (guitar/piano/kazoo), nature, mountain biking, and board sports.
